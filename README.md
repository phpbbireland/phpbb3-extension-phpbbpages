---------------------------  

* Adds a new Home Page to phpBB 3.1  
* Adds support and management for multiple pages to phpBB 3.1

A lot of people don't like the idea of adding a portal to their forum, 
comments like, overly complex, unnecessary and cluttered spring to mind...
This having being said, I would loose it big time if the same page greets me every day...
Even at phpBB.com, you are presented with what is essentially a welcome page, the contents of which changes from time to time...


**The basics:**  

To begin with, we provide a new home page (similar to the phpBB.com landing page), 
the contents and layout of which can be managed/determined in your ACP.
In addition to this new home page you can add additional pages to support whatever your needs...
Basically if some code or mod doesn't integrates into the index page it will almost certainly require a dedicated page...

**Wrapping the new pages:**  
* All new pages will be wrapped with the default header and footer 
* Pages can be one or two column, where one column will be a menu type column just like phpBB.com
* The menu/links column can be aligned right or left and will be of a fixed with...
* Styling will inherit from prosilver but can be overridden...
